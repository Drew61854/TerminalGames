# Terminal Games

Are you stuck on camera duty, bored out of your mind? Are you tired of babysitting the loot? Then look no further than Terminal Games!
With Terminal Games, you can sit comfortably in the satfey of the ship and entertain yourself with state-of-the-art video game technology such as:

## BlackJack

The classic card game, now digitized! Gamble your credits or play for free, see if you can beat the house! Try the all new double down feature, now
you can make even more credits!

## Numbers

A game often used to teach computer science brought directly to your computer, no science needed. Guess a number 1 to 1000 and get feedback on if your guess was too high or too low. You get ten guesses, can you solve this puzzle?

## Go Fish

Is it a game of luck, or a game of strategy? Nobody knows! Fish for books and attempt to reign victorious in this children's card game.

## Liar's Dice

The most complicated game you've never played, try to bluff or play it straight in this dice-based gambling game. You might be able to make it past the rules, but can you come out with your dice in your hand, or will you end up penniless? 

## Salvage Synergy

Do you miss the danger involved in being out of the ship? Do you wish you could explore dark corridors marked with the smell of death instead of living in the safety and air-conditioning of your ship? Then try out Salvage Synergy, a text-based adventure game about you--yes, you--and your job of scavenging for The Company! With our revolutionary strides in technology, you can play some Salvage Synergy, take a quick break to help your coworkers, and then come back and resume your game, with all your data intact! Can you escape the facility? 

## Hint

Do you know that one board game where you get hints about who a murderer is, what room the act was commited in and with what weapon? Well we can't
use the name of that board game due to copyright laws (even The Company has to follow the law), so instead we're introducing the all-original
board game Hint! Can't copyright a game type! Solve this mystery and win the game against two state-of-the-art artifical intellegence players.

## That's all, folks!

Since our New Year's update the number of staff working on the entertainment suite has...dwindled. There are many suspected reasons for this such as budget cuts, 
inefficiency and lack of a heartbeat, so that's why we're calling it quits. Maybe a bug fix in a little, but no new content (cuz we're out of ideas!) 
We hope you've enjoyed Terminal Games from version 1 to version 3, and we'll see you in the field. Keep an eye out for more to come, just not here. Glory to The Company!
