# Terminal Games

Are you stuck on camera duty, bored out of your mind? Are you tired of babysitting the loot? Then look no further than Terminal Games!
With Terminal Games, you can sit comfortably in the satfey of the ship and entertain yourself with state-of-the-art video game technology such as:

## BlackJack

The classic card game, now digitized! Gamble your credits or play for free, see if you can beat the house! Do you not know when to double and when to hit? Well don't worry, because you can't double. Why? Because The Company always wins. 

## Numbers

A game often used to teach computer science brought directly to your computer, no science needed. Guess a number 1 to 1000 and get feedback on if your guess was too high or too low. You get ten guesses, can you solve this puzzle?

## Go Fish

Is it a game of luck, or a game of strategy? Nobody knows! Fish for books and attempt to reign victorious in this children's card game.

## Liar's Dice

The most complicated game you've never played, try to bluff or play it straight in this dice-based gambling game. You might be able to make it past the rules, but can you come out with your dice in your hand, or will you end up pennyless? 

## Salvage Synergy

Do you miss the danger involved in being out of the ship? Do you wish you could explore dark corridors marked with the smell of death instead of living in the safety and air-conditioning of your ship? Then try out Salvage Synergy, a text-based adventure game about you--yes, you--and your job of scavenging for The Company! With our revolutionary strides in technology, you can play some Salvage Synergy, take a quick break to help your coworkers, and then come back and resume your game, with all your data intact! Can you escape the facility? 

## More to Come

The Company has chosen a more...direct approach to motivating us developers to create more content for our entertainment starved employees. That's why we've put our blood, sweat and tears (emphasis on the tears part) into this latest edition! We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoy still breathing, and have a happy New Year!
